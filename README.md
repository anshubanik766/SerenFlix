# 🎬 SerenFlix

A Discord Cinema Experience

SerenFlix is a Discord bot that simulates a virtual cinema.
It allows users to select movies, get watch links, coordinate screen-sharing in voice channels, and track watch activity all while staying within Discord’s rules.

⚠️ SerenFlix does not stream video directly (Discord limitation).
Instead, it smartly coordinates human screen sharing.
